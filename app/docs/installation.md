## Installation Steps

### 1. Create a New Next.js Project

Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash

```

Replace `my-next-project` with your desired project name.

### 2. Configuration Options

You'll be prompted with several configuration options. Here are the recommended choices for beginners:

Feel free to adjust these based on your preferences and project requirements.

### 3. Navigate to Your Project Directory

Once the installation is complete, move into your project folder:

cd my-next-project
```

### 4. Start the Development Server

Launch your Next.js application by running:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 5. View Your Application

Open your web browser and visit:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

You should see the Next.js welcome page.
