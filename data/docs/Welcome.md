# Yet Another Wiki

Yes, we know what you're thinking - *another* wiki platform? üôÑ 

But this one's different, promise! While exploring Nextra, Docusaurus, Bookstack and friends, we noticed something: most wikis seem to be built either for tech wizards who dream in markdown, or massive teams with dedicated DevOps departments. But what about the rest of us?

## Born From Frustration
(The mother of all inventions, right?)

You know that feeling when you just want to document stuff without:
- Teaching your entire team the sacred arts of markdown
- SSH-ing into servers just to update the company lunch menu
- Explaining to Bob from accounting why his `# Header` isn't working
- Running a kubernetes cluster just to maintain your D&D campaign notes

Yeah, we've been there too.

## What Makes This One Different?
(Besides our charming self-awareness)

### Content Creation That Doesn't Suck
- Powered by the fantastic [MDXEditor](https://mdxeditor.dev/) - because life's too short for bad editors
- Automatic table of contents that actually works
- Organize content like you'd organize your thoughts (or at least try to)
- URLs that humans can actually read and remember

### Looks Good Without Trying Too Hard
- Light mode for the optimists
- Dark mode for the realists
- Add your own logo (yes, even that one)
- Theme it until your heart's content

### By Real Humans, For Real Humans
- Code highlighting that just works (no PhD required)
- Write naturally with a rich text editor
- Simple setup that respects your time
- Works on phones because we all have them

### Navigation That Makes Sense
- Read it like a book (remember those?)
- Categories that actually categorize things
- Nested subcategories for the organizationally obsessed
- Breadcrumbs that won't get you lost

## Perfect For
- Solo maintainers tired of over-engineered solutions
- Teams where "git push" isn't part of everyone's vocabulary
- Documentation that needs to be, you know, actually maintained
- Anyone who believes wikis shouldn't require a CS degree
- Sleep-deprived parents documenting things at 3am (we've been there!)

## Ready to Wiki?

Check out our not-so-lengthy docs:
- [Setup Guide](/docs/setup) (it's actually easy)
- [Configuration](/docs/config) (you got this)
- [Content Management](/docs/content) (you'll figure it out)
- [Theming](/docs/themes) (go wild)
- [API Reference](/docs/api) (for the curious)

Built with ‚ù§Ô∏è and the occasional witty banter from Anthropic's Claude. Standing on the shoulders of giants (looking at you, Nextra, Docusaurus, and Bookstack) but with our own twist on things.

*P.S. We made this because we believe good documentation should be as easy to maintain as it is to read. Revolutionary, we know. Now go get some sleep!*
